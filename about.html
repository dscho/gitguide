		<h1>An Illustrated Guide to Git on Windows</h1>

		<h2 id="about">About</h2>

		<p>This document is designed to show that using git on Windows
		is not a difficult process. In this guide, I will create a
		repository, make several commits, create a branch, merge a
		branch, search the commit history, push to a remote server, and
		pull from a remote server. The majority of this will be done
		using GUI tools.</p>

		<p>Although this guide is targeted for use on Windows, the git gui tool
		works the same on all platforms. Because of this, git users on other
		platforms may find useful information here as well.</p>

		<p>If you have any comments about this guide, feel free to <a
