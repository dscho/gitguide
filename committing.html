		<h1>An Illustrated Guide to Git on Windows</h1>

		<h2 id="committing">Committing</h2>

		<p>Now that the repository has been created, it is time to
		create something to commit. For this example, I created a file
		called <span class="tt">main.c</span> with the following content:

		<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	printf("Hello world!\n");
	return 0;
}
</pre>

		<p>Clicking the <em>Rescan</em> button in the git gui will cause
		it to search out new, modified, and deleted files in the
		directory. In the next screenshot, git gui has found
		our new file (amazing, I know).</p>

		<p><img src="images/09.png" /></p>

		<p>To add the file for committing, click the icon to the left of
		the filename. The file will be moved from the <em>Unstaged
			Changes</em> pane to the <em>Staged Changes</em> pane. Now
		we can add a commit message and commit the change with the
		<em>Commit</em> button.</p>

		<p><img src="images/10.png" /></p>

		<p>Saying hello to the world is all well and good, but I would
		like my program to be more personal. Let's have it say hello to
		the user. Here's my code for that:</p>

		<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	char name[255];

	printf("Enter your name: ");
	fgets(name, 255, stdin);
	printf("length = %d\n", strlen(name)); /* debug line */
	name[strlen(name)-1] = '\0'; /* remove the newline at the end */

	printf("Hello %s!\n", name);
	return 0;
}
</pre>

		<p>I had some trouble figuring out why a newline was printed
		after the user's name, so I added a debugging line to help me
		track it down. I would like to commit this patch without the
		debug line, but I want to keep the line in my working copy to
		continue debugging. With git gui, this is no problem. First,
		click <em>Rescan</em> to scan for the modified file. Next,
		click the icon to the left of the filename to stage all
		modifications for commit. Then, right click on the debug
		line and chose <em>Unstage Line From Commit</em>.</p>

		<p><img src="images/11.png" /></p>

		<p>Now, the debug line has been unstaged, while the rest of the
		changes have been staged. From here, it is just a matter of
		filling in the commit message and clicking <em>Commit</em>.</p>
