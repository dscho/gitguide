		<h2 id="pushing">Pushing to a Remote Server</h2>

		<p>Before pushing to a remote server, you must first create a
		SSH public and private key pair. By using SSH, you will be able
		to securely authenticate to the server that you are who you say
		you are. Creating the key pair is a simple process. Begin by
		running the <span class="tt">puttygen.exe</span> program
		downloaded earlier.  Next, click the <em>Generate</em> button to
		generate the keys.  After processing for a few seconds, click
		the <em>Save private key</em> button to save your new private
		key. Copy the public key to the clipboard in preparation for the
		next step. I would recommend not clicking the <em>Save public
			key</em> button because the saved file is in a non-standard
		format; trying to use it with other software might be
		problematic.</p>

		<p>Now that the keys are generated, the remote servers need to
		know about it. If you would like to use <a
			href="http://github.com/">github</a> to host your code, just
		go to your account page and paste in the public key.</p>

		<p><img src="images/33.png" /></p>

		<p>Now github has our public key, but we do not yet have
		github's. To remedy this, launch <span
			class="tt">putty.exe</span>, connect to <span
			class="tt">github.com</span>, and click <em>Yes</em> to
		accept github's public key. You can safely close the login
		window that opens up after accepting the key.

		<p><img src="images/35.png" /></p>

		<p>We need our private key to be loaded up to use with our
		public key, so launch <span class="tt">pageant.exe</span>. This
		program will create an icon in your system tray. Double clicking
		on the icon will open up a window into which the private key can
		be added. Once the private key is added, the agent will sit in
		the background and provide authentication when needed.</p>

		<p><img src="images/36.png" /></p>

		<p>Now that our client and server can authenticate each other,
		it is time to push! <i>Remote &rarr; Push</i> will open up
		the push dialog. Typing in the commit address for the project
		and clicking <em>Push</em> will send the changes on their way.</p>

		<p>Of course, typing in the remote url would become quite
		annoying if we had to do it with every push. Instead, git allows
		us to alias the long urls using remotes. Git gui currently does
		not have a way to add a remote, so the command line must be
		used. Right click on the repository folder and choose <i>Git Bash Here</i>.
		In the prompt, enter the following command:</p>

		<pre>
git remote add github git@github.com:nathanj/example.git
</pre>

		<p>Note: After adding a remote, close and reopen git gui for it to recognize
		the new remote.</p>

		<p>Now the remote <span class="tt">github</span> is aliased to
		the url <span
			class="tt">git@github.com:nathanj/example.git</span>. When
		viewing the push dialog in git gui, a convenient drop down list
		of remotes is shown.</p>
