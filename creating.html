		<p><img src="images/01.png" /></p>

		<p>To create a repository, first create the folder you want the
		project to live under. Next, right click on the folder and
		choose <em>Git GUI Here</em>. Because there is no git repository
		in this folder yet, you will be presented with the git gui
		startup dialog.</p>

		<p><img src="images/02.png" /></p>

		<p>Choosing <em>Create New Repository</em> brings us to the next
		dialog.</p>

		<p><img src="images/03.png" /></p>

		<p>Fill in the path to your new directory and click Create. You
		will then be presented with the main interface of git gui, which
		is what will be shown from now on when you right click on your
		folder and click <em>Git GUI Here</em>.</p>

		<p><img src="images/04.png" /></p>

		<p>Now that the repository has been set up, you will need to tell
		git who you are so that commit messages will have the correct
		author. To do this, choose <i>Edit &rarr; Options</i>.</p>

		<p><img src="images/25.png" /></p>

		<p>In the options dialog, there are two versions of each
		preference. On the left side of the dialog are options that you
		want for this repository only, while the right side contains the
		global options which apply to all repositories. The defaults for
		these options are sensible so just fill in the user name and
		email for now. If you have a favorite font, you may want to set
		it now as well.</p>
