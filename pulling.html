		<h2 id="pulling">Pulling from a Remote Server</h2>

		<p>Because our code is so useful, dozens of people have
		downloaded and now use our program. One person in particular,
		Fred, has decided to fork our project and add his own commits.
		Now that he's added his code, he would like us to pull those
		commits from him into our repository. To do this, first create
		another remote.</p>

		<pre>
git remote add fred ssh://fred@192.168.2.67/home/fred/example
</pre>

		<p>Now we can fetch Fred's changes using <i>Remote &rarr; Fetch
			from &rarr; fred</i>.

		<p><img src="images/40.png" /></p>

		<p>After the fetch, Fred's commits have now been added to our
		local repository under the <span
			class="tt">remotes/fred/master</span> branch. We can use
		gitk to visualize the changes that Fred has made.</p>

		<p><img src="images/41.png" /></p>

		<p>If we like all of Fred's changes, we could do a normal merge
		as before. In this case though, I like one of his commits but
		not the other. To only merge one of his commits, right click on
		the commit and choose <i>Cherry-pick this commit</i>. The
		commit will then be merged into the current branch.</p>

		<p><img src="images/42.png" /></p>
		<p><img src="images/43.png" /></p>

		<p>We can now push a final time to send Fred's patch to our
		github tree for everyone to see and use.</p>
